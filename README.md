## üìå ToDo List

- [x] Release **global dataset statistics** (mean / std)  
- [x] Release **4D MoT** model  
- [x] Release **MV-DiT-7B** (based on *CogVideoX-5B*)  
- [ ] Release **MV-DiT-21B** (based on *Wan-2.1-14B*)
- [ ] Release a Hugging Face Demo Space


## üîç Abstract

Human image animation has attracted increasing attention and developed rapidly due to its broad applications in digital humans. However, existing methods rely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits generalization and discards essential 3D information.  
To tackle these problems, we propose **MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video Crafter)**, the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences for open-world human image animation beyond intermediate 2D representations.

- We introduce **4DMoT (4D motion tokenizer)** to encode raw motion data into discrete motion tokens, preserving 4D compact yet expressive spatio-temporal information.
- Then, we propose **MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT)**, which integrates a motion attention module and 4D positional encodings to effectively modulate vision tokens with motion tokens.
- The overall pipeline facilitates high-quality human video generation guided by 4D motion tokens.

MTVCrafter achieves **state-of-the-art results with an FID-VID of 6.98**, outperforming the second-best by approximately **65%**. It generalizes well to diverse characters (single/multiple, full/half-body) across various styles.

## üéØ Motivation

![Motivation](./static/images/Motivation.png)

Our motivation is that directly tokenizing 4D motion captures more faithful and expressive information than traditional 2D-rendered pose images derived from the driven video.

## üí° Method

![Method](./static/images/4DMoT.png)

*(1) 4DMoT*:
Our 4D motion tokenizer consists of an encoder-decoder framework to learn spatio-temporal latent representations of SMPL motion sequences,
and a vector quantizer to learn discrete tokens in a unified space.
All operations are performed in 2D space along frame and joint axes.

![Method](./static/images/MV-DiT.png)

*(2) MV-DiT*:
Based on video DiT architecture,
we design a 4D motion attention module to combine motion tokens with vision tokens.
Since the tokenization and flattening disrupted positional information,
we introduce 4D RoPE to recover the spatio-temporal relationships.
To further improve the quality of generation and generalization,
we use learnable unconditional tokens for motion classifier-free guidance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

We recommend using a clean Python environment (Python 3.10+).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MTVCrafter.git
cd MTVCrafter

# Create virtual environment
conda create -n mtvcrafter python=3.11
conda activate mtvcrafter

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For models regarding:

1. Download the NLF-Pose estimator we use (`nlf_l_multi.torchscript`) from the [NLF Release Page](https://github.com/isarandi/nlf/releases).

2. Download the pretrained CogVideoX-5B checkpoint from [CogVideoX-5B on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/CogVideoX-5b).

3. Download our MV-DiT and 4DMoT checkpoint from  [MTVCrafter Checkpoints on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/yanboding/MTVCrafter).



## üöÄ Usage

To animate a human image with a given 3D motion sequence,
you first need to obtain the SMPL motion sequnces from the driven video:

```bash
python process_nlf.py "your_video_directory"
```

Then, you can use the following command to animate the image guided by 4D motion tokens:

```bash
python infer.py --ref_image_path "ref_images/human.png" --motion_data_path "data/sample_data.pkl" --output_path "inference_output"
```

- `--ref_image_path`: Path to the image of reference character.
- `--motion_data_path`: Path to the motion sequence (.pkl format).
- `--output_path`: Where to save the generated animation results.

For our 4DMoT, you can run the following command to train the model on your dataset:

```bash
accelerate launch train_vqvae.py
```
